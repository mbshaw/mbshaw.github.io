The Maker's Grail is a record of my making journey to show how I made the various items I have made over the years. The aim is to record all the info I discovered along the way to help anyone planning to make similar items.

## A grail

The Maker's Grail came about while on a silversmithing course where I was making a raised silver whisky tumbler.
The [Merriam-Webster](https://www.Merriam-Webster.com) dictionary defined a [grail](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/grail) as "the object of an extended or difficult quest", which seemed to be a great desctiption of not only the tumbler but many of the things I have made.
